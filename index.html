                                                Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the bacon slices. Cook until
                                                crispy, flipping occasionally, for about 6-8 minutes. Remove the bacon
                                                from the skillet and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain
                                                excess grease. Once cooled, chop the bacon into bite-sized pieces.

                                            <li>
                                                In a mixing bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them together until well
                                                beaten. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, you can also
                                                add milk or cream to make the scrambled eggs creamier.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet where you cooked the bacon. Cook
                                                over medium-low heat, stirring gently with a spatula, until the eggs
                                                start to set.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                As the eggs begin to firm up but are still slightly runny, add the
                                                chopped bacon pieces to the skillet. Continue to cook, stirring
                                                occasionally, until the eggs are fully cooked and scrambled to your
                                                desired consistency.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Once the eggs are cooked through, remove the skillet from the heat and
                                                transfer the scrambled eggs with bacon to a serving plate.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Garnish with chopped chives or parsley if desired, and serve hot.
